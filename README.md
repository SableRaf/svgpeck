# SVGpeck

Sketch directly with vectors using a mouse or pen tablet. Save your drawings as SVG. 

If you own a pen plotter and you like to draw, this might be for you.

Note: SVGpeck is a minimalist piece of software with a very narrow use case. I couldn't find any tool that did precisely what I needed so I built it for my own usage (sending my birdie doodles to an AxiDraw). I hope some of you find it helpful too.

PS: If you enjoy SVGpeck, give it a star. And if your gratefulness needs another outlet, you can always buy me a coffee buy clicking the button below ðŸ˜‰
