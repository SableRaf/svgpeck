# svgpeck

Sketch directly with vectors using a mouse or pen tablet. Save your drawings as SVG. 

If you own a pen plotter and you like to draw, this might be for you.

Note: SVGpeck is a minimalist piece of software with a very narrow use case. I couldn't find any other tool that did what I needed so I built it for my own use (sending my birdie doodles to an AxiDraw). I hope some of you find it helpful too.

If you enjoy it, you can [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/sableraph/).
